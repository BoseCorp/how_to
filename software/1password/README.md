Password manager with simple sync via [Dropbox][sparkbox_dropbox] and mobile support.

How we use it
-------

All authenticated assets for Sparkbox and our clients are maintained in the Sparkvault.

#### Naming Conventions
When naming a new asset, follow the convention `client-asset-environment`.  Some examples:

* `sparkbox-seesparkbox.com-production`
* `fav_customer-mandrill-production`

#### Smart Folders
Each client should have a Smart Folder.  Criteria for this should be `Title begins with <client name>`.

#### Passwords
* Generate passwords when possible
