Meetups
=====

How to run a meetup at Sparkbox.

Website/Calendar
-------

 - Know/distribute Topic at least 3 weeks in advance (to have it before prior meetup would be ideal, so we can also announce at that)
 - Include the topics list
 - Backup topic

Buildup
-------

 - Tweets, and other social media. 
 - Invite your friends reminder, send out an anyvite, etc.
 - Day of, day prior, week prior, follow up w/feedback

Day Of
-------

 - Start music 15 prior
 - Start video recording (as needed)
 - Meetup Cleanup (from all the food mess, etc)
 - Follow up blog post (must have owner before leaving the meetup)

Food
-------

 - Different kind of foods. (Not always pizza, we can start off simple though, and ask attendees at the meetup for food feedback)  (lets keep a list of places & phone #â€™s if this is the case)
 - Snack foods (chips, etc)
 - Dietary needs.  (ask during registration, but mention in tweets) 
 - Plates, napkins will be needed as things could get messy. We should have an abundance on hand.
