Best Practices
==============

How to take what we have learned and apply it. Also how to avoid mistakes we have already made.

General
-------

* Content on websites should be available to as many people as possible.
* JS should not be required to view primary content on a website.
* Everyone is responsible for quality. 


EE
-------

* Don't use structure_entries tags.
* Favor Pixel and Tonic plug-ins. 
* Don't spend longer writing a new plug-in when one can be purchased. 


Email
-------

* Use [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com) to deliver email from code.
* Use [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/) for subscription mailing lists.


Testing
-------

* Write unit tests whenever possible.
* Write intergration tests whenever possible.
* Everything should be tested before the client has a chance to find problems.
* All issues should be tracked in github.

Browsers

Devices
-------

* Device testing should be done on all available devices (And we have several of them).
